Are your images 3D?,Are you trying to analyze images from a timelapse series?,What is the microscope methodology?,Does alignment and/or registration need to be applied before proceeding?,Is fluorescent bleedthrough present in these images?,How would you describe the signal-to-noise + signal-to-background ratios between background and true signal?,Is there a marker for the desired object that smoothly covers the whole object?,Is there a marker for the desired object that specifically highlights its edges?,Which if any of the following image quality issues are present? Select all that apply.,What object constraints (if any) should be used to filter objects for validity? Select all that apply.,What is the median object diameter?,Which object-intrinsic measurements should be made? Select all that apply,Measurements requring other objects and/or image context (select all that apply)
Yes,Yes,Brightfield - unstained,No registration required,NA/Not fluorescent and/or multichannel,NA/Not fluorescent,Yes,Yes,Overconfluence,Minimum / maximum diameter,1-3 px,Shape and/or size,Count of parent/child objects of a different type
No,No,Brightfield - histology stained,Need to align images to other images,No,Poor (histogram peaks nearly indistinguishable),No,No,Debris,Minimum / maximum count,3-10 px,Intensity values,Distance to/overlap with other objects of same type
"Yes, but I wish to Z project them before proceeding",,Fluorescence,Need to align images to a reference atlas,"Yes, but we don't need to apply a correction in this workflow",OK (histogram peaks obvious but overlapping),,,Inconsistent focus,Presence within another stain / object,10-30 px,Intensity spatial distribution,Distance to/overlap with other objects of a different type
