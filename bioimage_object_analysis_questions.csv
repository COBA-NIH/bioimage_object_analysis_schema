Are your images 3D?,Are you trying to analyze images from a timelapse series?,What is the microscope methodology?,Does alignment and/or registration need to be applied before proceeding?,Is fluorescent bleedthrough present in these images?,How would you describe the signal-to-noise + signal-to-background ratios between background and true signal?,Is there a marker for the desired object that smoothly covers the whole object?,Is there a marker for the desired object that specifically highlights its edges?,Which if any of the following image quality issues are present? Select all that apply.,What object constraints (if any) should be used to filter objects for validity? Select all that apply.,What shape is most characteristic of your objects?,"How much, if any, object overlap is expected?",What is the median object diameter?,Approximately how large is the size range between your biggest and smallest expected objects?,How much consistency in shape do your objects have?,How close will each object typically be to its nearest neighbors of the same object type?,Should objects touching the border of the image be removed?,Approximately how many objects of this type will be present in each image?,Which object-intrinsic measurements should be made?
